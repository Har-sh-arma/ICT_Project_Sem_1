# ICT_Project_Sem_1
Remote physical condition sensor

We are aiming to setup a client app and and arduino based server.
To display information regarding the arduino's evironment to a client's handset.

We'll be using Kotlin to implement the mobile application.
And using C++ to implement encoding a JSON object using the information collected from the attached sensors. Then this object will be transmitted over a TCP socket to the client app where it will be read and displayed.
If we get through all this quickly enough we will try to integrate a thermostat and humidifier into the system.
THIS PROJECT IS LIT.....
